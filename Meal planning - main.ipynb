      "This Egg Mushroom Potato Frittata is a healthy option for a person with diabetes. The ingredients are low in carbohydrates making them suitable for diabetic diets. The olive oil is a healthy fat which can help lower cholesterol levels, while the potatoes, onion, and mushrooms contain fiber which can help regulate blood sugar levels. In addition, the eggs provide protein which can help with blood sugar control. The Parmesan cheese is also a good source of calcium, which is important for maintaining strong bones. Finally, the small amount of flour provides a little bit of carbs and is low in sugar. Altogether, this recipe is a great option for a person with diabetes as it is low in carbohydrates and high in fiber and healthy fats.\n"
